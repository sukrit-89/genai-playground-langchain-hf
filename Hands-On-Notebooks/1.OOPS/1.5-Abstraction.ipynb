    "It defines an abstract base class Vehicle with an abstract start_engine method and a concrete drive method; the derived Car class implements start_engine. The operate_vehicle function shows how code interacts with the abstract interface (start_engine, drive) without needing class internals — illustrating cleaner, modular design and polymorphism. Small takeaway: always implement required abstract methods in subclasses so they can be instantiated."
