Syntax and Semantics in Python

Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in a language. In simpler terms, syntax is about the correct arrangement of words and symbols in a code.

Semantics refers to the meaning or the interpretation of the symbols, characters, and commands in a language. It is about what the code is supposed to do when it runs.

Variables in python
Variables are fundamental elements in programming used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

DataTypes
1. Definition:
Data types are a classification of data which tell the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.
They determine the type of operations that can be performed on the data, the values that the data can take, and the amount of memory needed to store the data.
2. Importance of Data Types in Programming
Explanation:

Data types ensure that data is stored in an efficient way.
They help in performing correct operations on data.
Proper use of data types can prevent errors and bugs in the program.

Indentation
Indentation in Python is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces {} to delimit blocks of code, Python uses indentation to determine the grouping of statements. This means that all the statements within a block must be indented at the same level.
